            <h2><b><u>Important Info</u></b></h2>
            <p>Pasta with a sauce is one of the foods that I usually have. <br>
            I am sure that most Somalis eat it most of the time; <br> therefore, I can say it is a part
       of the things we normalise.<br> That food has more calories, but again, no one cares if it 
    is balanced food. <br> However, there are people who eat some other food with it to balance their
diet, <br> and these people are mostly the richer ones.  </p>
